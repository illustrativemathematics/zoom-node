# Zoom Node.js Library

The Zoom Node.js library provides convenient access to Zoom's REST API.
This client library assumes usage of the [Server-to-Server OAuth](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/build/server-to-server-oauth-app/)
authentication flow.

**Note:** This library is a work-in-progress and does not exhaustively
cover the Zoom REST API. Additionally, it's only been used in
production with Node.js version 16.15.1.

## Documentation

This library is based on the [Zoom Meeting API 2.0.0](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/methods/#overview)
REST API. More details can be found [there](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api/methods/#overview).
